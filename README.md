OSPO's policies for adherence to security best practices.
[Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) is a security-policy GitHubApp, that continously monitors organizations for adherence to security best practices, and it is installed in [this organization](https://github.com/kommitters). This repo holds the configuration necessary for all the [policies][policies] with its respective [actions][actions] of allstar in the org.

In the [allstar.yaml][allstar_yaml] file we have the general configuration for allstar, like the strategy to be used, the repos to be included or excluded and some other repo level configurations.

If you need to configure allstar for your own organization you can fork this repo and modify the `yaml` files to match your needs, remember that this repo has to remain with this name `.allstar`, for more information read [Allstar installation][installation_options].

## Policy configuration

The application is running on all the repos of this organization with the `OptOutStrategy` strategy with the following configurations:
