# How to contribute

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute, it is encouraging! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes that help the [.allstar][repo] all star configuration repo. There are a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow so that we can merge your changes quickly.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Create a GitHub issue for your contribution, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce if it is a bug.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Try to keep your local repository in a "rebased" state.

## Finding things to work on

The first place to start is always looking over the current GitHub issues for the project you are
interested in contributing to. Issues marked with [good first issue][good-first-issue] or [help wanted][help-wanted] are usually pretty self-contained and a good place to get started.

If you see any issues that are assigned to a particular person or have the `Work in progress` label, it means that
someone is currently working on that issue.

Of course, feel free to create a new issue if you think something needs to be added or fixed.

## Making changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the `main|master` branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `main|master` branch.

## Submitting changes

* All content, comments, pull requests and other contributions must comply with the
  [Code of Conduct][coc].
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request.
  * Include a descriptive [commit message][commit-msg].
  * Changes contributed via pull request should focus on a single issue at a time.
  * Rebase your local changes against the `main|master` branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise.

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three
business days (typically, one business day). We may suggest some changes, improvements or
alternatives.
